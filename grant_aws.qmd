  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfApI2auGXw" target="_blank"><img alt="Tutorial Video" width="1728" height="1053" src="img/AWS IMAGINE Grant Application Tutorial - Award packages.png" style="width:100%;height:100%" /></a>
  - Award package includes:
      - Unrestricted cash funding
      - AWS computing credits
      - Access to AWS technical specialists
      - Access to cloud training
      - Opportunities for marketing promotions by AWS

- My takes on it (1.5 speed video):

  * Importance of holistics approach ie: provide tech + support

  * "Momentum to modernize": We are really looking for organization that view these types of project as fundational steps" (setting up the fundation to unlock futur doors)

  * "To go further faster award": "Thing big", "highly innovative program", "DevOps"

  * "Always lead the mission with technology as a core strategic enablement"

  * "Senior leader who is the project champion"

  * "convey urgency and importance of your project"

  * "work backward from the end user": we are lacking here, I think first end user is us, them bb team, then ISP / BB consultant, then citizen

  * "end goal connect your mission"

  * "dynamic dashboard": should we look into quicksight?

  * "what services will it use": S3, next is do we have a spark question or a duck db question

  * "how do the technical elements fits together":

    I think our data warehouse is good we want to leverage a data lake to select more valuable data to move to teh data warehouse/product phase

    * "what skill resources do you have in house"

    * "what you plan to acquire the most"

    - organizing assets in data lake (S3) and build an infrastructure to query it
    - core data: broadband data (Open Data Lakehouse?)
    - expose it to partner / first end user
    - open it to more partners

    * Maybe we can use some AI ML on checking FCC data against location (presence or not) and MLAB on quality of services

    * "articulate why each piece of the imagine grant is useful not only cash"

    * research long term (maybe more for phase 2)

    * automate the ingestion delivery

    * technical diagram: AWS architecture diagrams


- We can contact the AWS Nonprofits team ([form](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/contact/)), and should, we need to prepare an **high level summary before**  


first goal do we need some kind of bb data hub?

## Retro-Planning for the MDA

- Decide on an what we want to do: Dead line May 16

- Write high level summary and get feedback from AWS Team May 17[^aws_ref] 

[^aws_ref]: p11 of AWS Imagine 2024

- Write the grant with feedback from AWS 

- MDA proposition should be done May 24

- Giving us buffer we (Robin?/Mike?) want to submit May 30

## first brainstorm: 

At CORI we are helping rural communities and their leaders understand the rural divide and reduce it.
This is a critical moment for broadband funding and infrastructure expansion that will have major impacts on communities across the nation.
Our broadband team contributes to it and our research team provides insights on how this affects communities.

Both rely on fresh, actionable and easy to share data.
To do that our mapping and data team have been ingested, processed FCC data and shared those results either with web apps or with in-house analytics.
Sadly our manual processes do not allow us:
- to keep up with the volume and frequencies of FCC releases
- to add different sources (MLab, Ookla) of data and combine them 
- get the granularity that expert on the ground needs
- keep memory over time, trends, to drive thought leadership
- expand our audience

In its ever evolving landscape, being able to efficiently capture and store data with the help of AWS infrastructure will create valuable resources for our partner and communities. 

Both the "Momentum to Modernize" and "Go Further, Faster" grants could potentially help us and provide new opportunities to become a hub and source of truth/expertise on broadband data.

The maturity, expertise and "urgency" to works with broadband data make it an important "first target" in our oganization data stratgey and we are excited to learn from it and expand from it to other area CORI (venture capital and tech talent in rural area).

## Technical Design

1. Describe your project’s technical design at a high level. What does it do and how? [200 - 350
words]

The goals are to build an analytics data lakehouse that centralizes broadband data to support broadband expansion, grant applications and research on broadband equity and development.

We are currently using a data warehouse solution based on RDS database cluster that works great once we have a clear understanding of what our partners need but the rapid change in the broadband landscape makes that approach too slow to innovate and serve our communities in the necessary timeframe.

We need intermediate places and processes that allow us to catalog our assets, then work on non structured data and provide quick insights for important feedback loops with partners and stakeholders. The size of broadband data makes it in the beginning of the realm of big data and typical in memory solutions are reaching their limits. 

We can identify three key challenges in our implementation. 

The first is that the data lake house will need to have integration for both power users (integration with R)  and integration with regular users (BI tools). The processing need to be adaptable to the rapidly changing needs of ech group of users. The main tool allowing us that path will be AWS Lambda and each lambda function will be the product of structued feedback cycle betwwen the developpers and users.

The second is that even if we start building it for internal users we would like it to scale for external users allowing us to serve the broadband community and rural places at the heart of our organization. We can utalize AWS Cognito to manage and control access at the applications level. 

 The third is, while opening our infrastructure, we will need to improve our data governance strategy referencing data lineage and catalog. 


— 

I think right now we are good with the AWS lambda function but we need a way to build intermediary tools/workflow on top of Lambda functions (expand) in alignment with data user/stakeholder needs. IE this data lake needs an efficient way to query, do quick and shareable visualizations and integrate well with our "production" pipeline.

Then we need to build the infrastructure to ease the query of such data: do we have a spark question or duckDB/parquet question (scope needed here prob: R package versus use of AWS solution?).

Idea on machine learning: FCC data is declarative data and needs to be confronted either on local knowledge and/or other data sources:: census data, MLAB ?: anomaly detection/outlier detection?. It comes after the fact that we can use multiple sources of data to get closer to reality on the ground and build better bb infrastructure?

Question on being public/managing permission on that (cognito).



2. What type(s) of workload(s) will your project include? [Select all that apply] (Hint: Learn more

  v) None of the above

3. Describe the resources and technical skills you may need to complete the project successfully.
Do you have these resources in-house? If no, what will be your plan to acquire the skills
needed? [200 - 350 words]

CORI’s Mapping and Data Analytics (MDA) team consists of seasoned software engineers, data scientists, website developers, and geospatial analysts. 
They are familiar with AWS services to deploy web applications, RDS instances and AWS lambda using either the SDK or the AWS GUI.
Training will be needed on moving away from using the GUI to implement solution using R (the common language in the team) for managing s3 (list assets, write/read, manage permissions). We are also planning  on using new services like AWS Service Catalog and connecting both our RDS instances to Quicksigh. 

The MDA team has plan and budgeded X amount of hours of personnal development that they want to apply to AWS training. On a same time we already have a partnership with Merging Future and our 2024 budget include  hours of consulting with them to be our sparing partners in our cloud endeavors. Building on these newly developped expertise the team want to disseminate the use of AWS services in our organizations and bring more people outside of the MDA to use tools that allow more data driven decisions.  

AWS credit provided by the AWS Imagine grant will go a long way to helps us support the cost of prototyping, testing multiple solutions and bring new coworkers to use it.
