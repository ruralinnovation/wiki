## US census developper section: 

The US census has resources for developpers: [https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html](https://www.census.gov/data/developers.html) 

Decennial data only go back to [2000](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/decennial-census.html) but historical data are also provided by [IPUMS NHGIS](https://www.nhgis.org/data-availability).

### The [American Community Survey (ACS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html) ...

  - is an ongoing initiative within the United States Census Bureau
  - releases a variety of data tables every year covering a wide range of social, economic, housing, and demographic data
  - ACS has two types of data "profile" and "table" 

### A **Block** ...

  - is the smallest geographic area for which the Bureau of the Census collects and tabulates decennial census data
  - is the smallest statistical unit of analysis of a single Community's economic participation, social impact, and inventory of tech ecosystem resources (?)
  - is the smallest geospatial unit at which we can geographically place, filter or group Broadband Serviceable Location data
  - is a collection of [Broadband Serviceable Location](#a-broadband-serviceable-location-bsl)(s)
  - can not be statistically described by data that is attributed to the block group, tract census boundaries that forming the set of blocks to which it belongs
  - may be a constituent component of one and only one block group
  - is a constituent component of one and only one [tract](#a-tract)

### A **Block Group** ...

  - is ...

### A **Tract** ...

  - Started being used in 1910 (NY city), **at first** should follow rivers and roads and contains around 400 peoples.
  - if divided between two new tracts and should follow this kind of pattern[^census_tract]

  [^census_tract]: Census Tract O3 (parent) is divided in Census Tract 03.01 (child 1) and Census Tract 03.02. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOe4alPmjss

Note Olivier 26-04-2024: still unclear how that translate in `geoid_tr` and how do they deal when we move from two "parents" to one "child" 
:::

  - is a union of the set of blocks and/or block groups that are located within a specified geographical boundary (unsure about that do they start from block and build tract or tract and divide in block)
  - is often arbitrary, except for coinciding with political lines, in [unincorporated areas](#an-unincorporated-area) of the United States
  - for some metrics, can be statistically described by the aggregation of statistics for each of its constituent blocks

### A **Rural Tract** ...

  - is ...

### An **Unincorporated Area** ...

  - is a region that is not governed by a local municipality, see also Census Designated Space (CDP)[^CDP]

### A **ZIP ("Zone Improvement Plan") code / ZCTA**  ...

  - is a designation for a mail delivery route, they usually follow roads that ware assigned to a postman.
  - is, at the smallest level, tied to an address (point).
  - can be linked to a census tabulation blocks by Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) provided by the Census Bureau.[^zcta]

# Broadband related terminology

### A **Broadband Serviceable Location** (BSL) ...
  - is “a business or residential location in the United States at which mass-market fixed broadband Internet access service is, or can be, installed.”[^bslsource]

  [^bslsource]: source:  https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/16842264428059-About-the-Fabric-What-a-Broadband-Serviceable-Location-BSL-Is-and-Is-Not

  - is a location that can have access to multiple ISPs, each offering different services (technologies, upload, download speed).
  - can be split into residential and business locations but this distinction does not seem very effective in the [National Broadband Map](#the-national-broadband-map) dataset.
  - is not geographically represented with exact latitude and longitude, but only by [census block](#a-block) geoid and H3 index in the NBM dataset (MDA references this data as the National Broadband Map; officially the dataset is released as [BDC (Broadband Data Collection) Public Data](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/data-download/nationwide-data)).

### The [National Broadband Map](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/) ...

  - is an ongoing initiative within the Federal Communications Commission
  - provides information about the internet services available to individual locations across the country, along with new maps of mobile coverage, as reported by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in the FCC’s ongoing Broadband Data Collection.

### An **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** ...

  - is a FCC provider (with a provider ID)?[^ispid]

  [^ispid]:In the FCC Broadband Map they are defined by a `frn`, `provider_id` and `brand_name`. We are mostly working with the one who are providing "fixed" services.

# Data related terminology

### A **Data Archive** ...

  - is a remote store for one or more _immutable_ artifacts of source data or outputs of product data
  - is a system for storing, documenting, and indexing versions of data artifacts

### A **Data Cache** ...

  - is a remote store for one or more _mutable_ representations or views of a data product

> ~~Rural ...~~
> "Rural" is an adjective for the purpose of this list; it should be applied to other terms (i.e. A Rural County ...)
